- 📝 Subtitle parsing and alignment
- 🧠 Media orchestration (Mediapilot)
- 🛠 System utilities (AppleScript, Shell)
- 🧩 Modular library architecture
- 🚀 AI-ready (STT, TTS, LLMs)

## Folder Structure
- Applications/Utilities → system automation
- Lib → shared logic and helpers
- Mediapilot → media orchestration core
- Subtitle → subtitle parsing & timing
- Tools → utilities and scripts

## Use Cases
- Podcast automation
- News-to-audio pipelines
- AI narration engines
- Radio & mic output systems
- Media preprocessing for AI agents

## Status
